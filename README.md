### `mdopt` is a python package built on top of `numpy` for discrete optimisation (mainly for classical and quantum decoding) in the tensor-network (specifically, Matrix Product States / Operators) language. The intended audience includes physicists, quantum information / error correction researchers, and those interested in exploring tensor-network methods beyond traditional applications.

## Installation

To install the current release, use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```bash
pip install mdopt
```

Otherwise, you can clone the repository and use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

```bash
poetry install
```

## Minimal example

```python
import numpy as np
import qecstruct as qec
from examples.decoding.decoding import decode_css

# Define a small instance of the surface code
LATTICE_SIZE = 3
surface_code = qec.hypergraph_product(
    qec.repetition_code(LATTICE_SIZE),
    qec.repetition_code(LATTICE_SIZE),
)

# Input an error and choose decoder controls
logicals, success = decode_css(
    code=surface_code,
    error="IIXIIIIIIIIII",
    bias_prob=0.1,
    bias_type="Bitflip",
    chi_max=64,
    renormalise=True,
    contraction_strategy="Optimised",
    tolerance=0,
    silent=False,
)
```

## Examples

The [examples](https://github.com/quicophy/mdopt/tree/main/examples) folder contains full workflows that demonstrate typical use cases, such as quantum / classical LDPC code decoding, ground state search for the quantum Ising model and random quantum curcuit simulation. Each example is fully documented and serves as a starting point for building your own experiments.
The package has been tested on macOS and Linux (Compute Canada clusters) and does not currently support Windows.
