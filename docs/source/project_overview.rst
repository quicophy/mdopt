Project Overview & References
=============================

Motivation
----------

``mdopt`` expresses discrete optimisation tasks in the tensor-network (MPS/MPO) formalism.
This enables controlled approximations (e.g., bond-dimension truncation) and leverages
well-studied contraction/optimisation techniques for problems such as decoding quantum
error-correcting codes.

Intended users
--------------

- Physicists and quantum-information researchers
- Practitioners exploring tensor-network methods for discrete optimisation
