``mdopt`` is a Python package for discrete optimisation in the tensor-network
language (MPS/MPO/DMRG). It targets problems such as quantum error-correction decoding with a code-agnostic workflow and is intended to be easily extensible to other applications.

For installation and a minimal working example, see :doc:`getting_started`.
For a curated overview of notebooks, see :doc:`examples`.
